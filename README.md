# SlotString

FSM-based template string formatting classes implemented using only native Java features, with little to no counter-intuitive implicit conversion features, are used in place of `MessageFormat.format()`.

Current source code version: `0.2.2`.

## Usage

Utility source see `SlotString.java`. 

Example see `SlotStringTest.java`ã€‚

If it is not appropriate to add the whole class to your project, you can copy the source code of the `qformat` method to your class and manually inline the source code of the `parse` and `parseQformat` methods, and manually inline and adjust the multithreading related fields and judgment code according to the actual multithreading usage. If you are using it in a multi-threaded scenario, you can also move the two buffers to the class as fields and change the type to `StringBuffer`.

## Performance

500000 loops are tested on personal computer, for reference only.

See `SlotStringTest.testPerformance()`
